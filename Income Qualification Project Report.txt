Income Qualification Project ReportProject Overview:The goal of this project is to identify the level of income qualification needed for families in Latin America, specifically focusing on improving the accuracy of the Proxy Means Test (PMT) used to verify income qualification. The PMT algorithm considers observable household attributes to classify and predict the level of need for aid. The project utilizes a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics to explore new methods beyond traditional econometrics.Actions Performed:1. Identify the Output Variable:- The output variable is the level of income qualification needed for families, as predicted by the Proxy Means Test (PMT) algorithm.2. Understand the Type of Data:- Explore the dataset to understand the nature of features, their types, and their relationships.3. Check for Biases:- Examine the dataset for biases, especially in the distribution of the target variable.4. Household Poverty Level:- Checked that all members of the house have the same poverty level.- Checked for houses without a family head ; Found 7334 houses without family head.- Set the poverty level of members and the head of the house the same in a family.5. Handling Null Values:- Count the number of null values existing in columns.- Remove null value rows of the target variable.6. Random Forest Classifier:- Predicted the accuracy using a random forest classifier; Accuracy using Random Forest Classifier: 0.12919896640826872- Checked accuracy using a random forest with cross-validation.Results are as below: Cross-validation scores: [0.15245478 0.16795866 0.13953488 0.12403101 0.12694301]Mean Accuracy using Random Forest Classifier with Cross-Validation: 0.14218446666934437Conclusion:This project addresses the challenge of accurately identifying the level of income qualification for families in Latin America. By leveraging machine learning and exploring new methods, we aim to contribute to the enhancement of the Proxy Means Test (PMT) algorithm.
